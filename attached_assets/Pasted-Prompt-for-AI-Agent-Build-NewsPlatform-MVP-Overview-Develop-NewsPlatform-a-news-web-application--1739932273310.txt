Prompt for AI Agent: Build NewsPlatform MVP
Overview:

Develop NewsPlatform, a news web application that enables users to sign up, publish articles, manage channels, and engage with content through likes, dislikes, comments, and subscriptions. The goal is to create a fully functional minimum viable product (MVP) with a modern, mobile-friendly design, built using React, TypeScript, Next.js, and Supabase.

Key Features:

Authentication:
Implement OAuth login with Twitter (X), Google, and Facebook.
Include manual sign-up/login with username and password.
Channel Management:
Automatically create a channel for a user when they publish their first article (user can name it).
Allow users to manage up to 10 channels.
Article Management:
Enable users to publish, edit, archive (unpublish), or delete articles.
Articles are tied to a single channel and include title, content, and metadata (location, category).
User Interactions:
Allow users to like (upvote), dislike (downvote), and comment on articles (flat or threaded comments).
Subscriptions:
Users can subscribe to channels to receive updates on new articles.
Search Functionality:
Provide search by location (country, city, region) and category (e.g., politics, sports, entertainment).
Notetaking:
Basic tools for authors (e.g., brainstorming, references) and readers (e.g., private notes on articles/channels).
Technical Requirements:

Tech Stack:
Use React with TypeScript for the frontend.
Use Next.js for server-side rendering and API routes.
Use Supabase for authentication, database, and storage.
Database Schema:
Design tables for users, channels, articles, likes, dislikes, comments, subscriptions, and notes.
Ensure relationships: articles belong to channels, channels belong to users.
Performance:
Optimize for fast loading and smooth interactions, laying a foundation for future scalability.
Design & User Experience:

Create a responsive, mobile-friendly design that works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
Use a clean, modern aesthetic with intuitive navigation and a polished look.
Prioritize ease of use: streamlined onboarding, simple content creation, and easy browsing/subscribing.
Additional Notes:

Focus on core functionality: rapid content creation, channel-based publishing, and user engagement.
Avoid implementing monetization features (e.g., ads, premium tiers) in the MVP, but ensure the structure supports future additions.
Aim for a joyful user experience, especially on smartphones, with fast performance and clear visuals.
Goal:

Build a high-quality MVP that showcases NewsPlatform’s value: effortless publishing, engaging interactions, and a delightful mobile-optimized experience. The app should be ready for testing and set the stage for future growth.

Notes for You
I’ve excluded monetization details (e.g., revenue sharing, ads) as requested, keeping the focus on the MVP’s core features.
The prompt emphasizes styling and mobile optimization (“looks good and mobile-friendly”) per your request, without prescribing a specific design style—leaving room for the AI to interpret “modern and clean.”
If you have questions or want to tweak anything (e.g., add more detail on search or notetaking), let me know!
This prompt should give the AI agent everything it needs to build a detailed, functional, and impressive MVP for NewsPlatform. Ready to proceed?
